IDE: IntelliJ IDEA 11.1.1
Libraries used:
	- Android-ViewPagerIndicator (https://github.com/JakeWharton/Android-ViewPagerIndicator)
	
Known bugs / Unimplemented features:
	- Changing the "Phone" app density doesn't apply to the actual Phone.apk, since the launcher icon is actually in Contacts.apk.
	  This will be manually overridden in the future.
	- "Special" tab is empty, it will eventually display non-launcher apps like keyboards, SystemUI, etc.
	
Feel free to fork and make any improvements.
